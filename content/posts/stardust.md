The universe-
it shatters the ego in the most brutal way possible.
we are, with minds that can dream, imagine, and wonder about what’s out there, even if we can’t physically go.

Maybe that’s one of the most beautiful but frustrating things about being human.
we have this endless curiosity for the unknown, but our ability to reach it is so limited.
