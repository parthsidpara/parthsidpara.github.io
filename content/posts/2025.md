### 2025 Highlights
- Completed a remote internship.
- Launched my first freemium Chrome extension.
- Won a hackathon.
- Worked on various interesting projects.
- Got a 9 GPA for the first time (though this is less important to me as of now).
- Had some good trips with friends.

### Key Lessons
- Action is better than waiting for the perfect strategy and perfect time. 
- Execution matters most.

### 2026 Goals
- Build strong fundamentals.
- Do one (minimum) internship.
- Scale and put more work into the startup.
- Write more blogs.
- Focus on health.
- Start investing.

### Topics to Explore 
I want to deep dive and research these areas (outside of academics):
- Computer Science: HCI, Networking, OS internals, Database internals.
- Science: Physics, Energy systems, The Moon.
- Others: Education system, Manufacturing, Economics.


Thank You <3
